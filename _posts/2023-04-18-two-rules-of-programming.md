There are two golden rules of programming that I always take to heart. As long
as you follow both these rules you will definitely write good code:

1. Always write code as if you are going to be hit by a bus tomorrow.
2. Always write code as if the person who will maintain your code is going to
   be driving a bus straight at you.

Now, who said programming was easy?
