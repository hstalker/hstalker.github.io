# __About the Site__

Sigbus Factor is a blog about whatever subject strikes my fancy. The title is a
portmanteau of the terms ["sigbus"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error) and
["bus factor"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor). Sometimes sigbuses can
harm projects about as much buses. One of the projects I worked on quite early
into my career was plagued by sigbuses, and this left a lasting impression.

I try to keep this blog minimal — One would hope this would encourage a person
to write more often, but such is life!


# __About Me__
*I'll leave the third-person introductions for my resume :)*

I am Hector Stalker: A professional software developer (since ~2018), with a
degree in Computer Science and hobbyist experience dating circa mid-2000s. I
tend to work on core infrastructure technologies revolving around
high-performance, high-reliability systems.

__Professional Work:__

 * Financial services technology
   * Regulatory reporting
   * Electronic trading systems
   * Internal developer tooling
   * JIT compilers
   * Compression algorithms
   * Crisis debugging
   * Software resiliency & performance tuning
   * Testing infrastructure

__Areas of Hobbyist Work:__

 * Compilers, programming language design and semantics (some relatively
   esoteric)
 * Reverse engineering (software and file formats)
 * A wealth of other stuff I'm probably forgetting about

I am also near fluent in Japanese (I say 'near' because I am severely out of
practice at actually using it to communicate, despite extremely high levels of
more passive comprehension). In the — admittedly very distant — past I have also
studied some German and French.

Please see the footer on the site for my social details. Feel free to reach out
to me via some avenue or another.
