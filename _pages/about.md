# __About the Site__

Sigbus Factor is a blog about whatever subject strikes my fancy. The title is a
(strained portmanteau of the terms
["SIGBUS"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error) and ["bus
factor"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor). Sometimes SIGBUSes can harm
projects about as much buses. One of the projects I worked on quite early into
my career was plagued by SIGBUSes, and the difficulty of debugging these issues
left a lasting impression on me.

I try to keep this blog minimal — One would hope this would encourage a person
to write more often, but such is life!


# __About Me__
*I'll leave the third-person introductions for my resume*

I am Hector: A professional software developer (since ~2018), with a degree in
Computer Science and hobbyist experience dating back to circa mid-2000s. In my
career I tend to work on relatively low-level core infrastructure technologies
revolving around high-performance, high-reliability systems. A surprising amount
of my work tends to involve API design and related programmer UX work also. I
have been programming in C++ for a _very_ long time, and due to the nature of my
work that is often the language of the day, but am capable of using (and
regularly do use) whatever tool I need to get the job at hand complete.


__Professional Work:__

 * Financial services technology (regulatory reporting & high performance
   electronic trading systems)


In terms of subject matter, this work may involve the design, implementation &
maintenance of:

 * Internal developer tooling & libraries
 * Compilers & interpreters
 * Efficient & resilient transport mechanisms, IPC mechanisms etc.
 * Compression algorithms
 * Software resiliency & performance tuning
 * Testing infrastructure

to list just a few subject areas.


__Areas of Hobbyist Work:__

 * Compilers, programming language design and semantics
 * Reverse engineering (software and file formats) & software security
 * Game design & implementation
 * Endless tweaking of my tools
 * A wealth of other stuff that I am probably forgetting about

I am fairly fluent in Japanese (though severely out of practice with actually
using it to communicate — my passive comprehension is at a very high level).
In the past I have also studied German and French. In general I am quite
interested in language acquisition.

Please see the footer on the site for my social details. Feel free to reach out
to me via any reasonable point of contact.
