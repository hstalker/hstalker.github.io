# __About the Site__

Sigbus Factor is a blog about whatever subject strikes my fancy. The title is a
strained portmanteau of the terms ["SIGBUS"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error)
and ["bus-factor"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor). Sometimes SIGBUSes
can harm projects about as much buses. One of the projects I worked on quite
early into my career was plagued by SIGBUSes, and the difficulty of debugging
these issues left a lasting impression (translation: trauma) on me.

I try to keep this blog minimal. I apologize in advance for my verbosity.

# __About Me__
*I'll leave the third-person introductions for my resume*

I am Hector: A professional software developer (since ~2018), with a degree in
Computer Science and hobbyist experience dating back to circa mid-2000s. In my
career I tend to work on relatively low-level core infrastructure technologies
revolving around high-performance, high-reliability systems.

My day job is currently primarily C++, but I frequently use whatever tool I need
to use (just to name a few: Python, Perl, Shell, Lua, Make, x86 Assembly, Java,
C, etc). My interest in languages and compiler technology means I find little
difficulty in picking up new languages and environments.


__Professional Work:__

 * Financial services technology (high performance electronic trading systems &
   regulatory reporting)


In terms of subject matter, this work may involve the design, implementation &
maintenance of:

 * Internal developer tooling & libraries
 * Compilers & interpreters
 * Efficient & resilient transport mechanisms, IPC mechanisms etc.
 * Compression algorithms
 * Software resiliency & performance tuning
 * Testing infrastructure

to list just a few subject areas.


__Areas of Hobbyist Work:__

 * Compilers, programming language design and semantics
 * Reverse engineering (software and file formats) & software security
 * Game design & implementation
 * Endless tweaking of my tools
 * A wealth of other stuff that I am probably forgetting about

I am a fluent reader of Japanese (though severely out of practice with actually
using it to communicate). In the past I have also studied German and French. In
general I am quite interested in language acquisition and would be very open to
opportunities abroad.

Please see the footer on the site for my social details. Feel free to reach out
to me via any reasonable point of contact.
